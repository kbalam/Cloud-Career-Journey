# Week 06 ‚Äì Cloud Learning Track

---

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered ‚Äì Day 1

- S3 architecture and permission models
- Types of access errors (403, 404, etc.)
- IAM policies vs bucket policies vs ACLs
- Block public access settings
- Using AWS CLI to simulate and debug S3 access issues

---

## üß™ Hands-On

- Created an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI and Console
- Uploaded test object (Sample.txt) via CLI
- Created IAM user with restricted S3 access
- Simulated the following S3 errors:
  - `403 AccessDenied`: No permission or blocked by policy
  - `404 Not Found`: Object missing or wrong bucket
  - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid bucket/object URL
- Used the `--debug` flag to trace CLI permission failures
- Fixed permission issues step-by-step:
  - Updated IAM policy to allow `s3:GetObject`
  - Removed explicit deny from bucket policy

## Scripts

- [IAM Policy](./Scripts/policy.json)
- [Bucket Policy](./Scripts/S3ReadOnlyPolicy.json)

## üß† Reflections

- Learned how S3 permissions are layered: IAM + bucket policy + block public access
- `403` can mean multiple root causes ‚Äî not just lack of permission
- `404` happens even with permission if the object path is wrong
- CLI `--debug` flag is extremely helpful for root cause tracing
- This mirrors how real customer S3 issues come in at L1 support level
