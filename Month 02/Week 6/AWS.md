# Week 06 ‚Äì Cloud Learning

This week simulates common real-world AWS support issues using CLI, debugging flags, and IAM policy evaluation. Each task mirrors actual L1/L2 support tickets handled in production environments.

|-----|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | S3      | Access issues, permission models, 403/404 errors |
| 2   | EC2     | SSH access, key pair & security group issues     |
| 3   | IAM     | AccessDenied errors & policy troubleshooting     |

## üß™ Hands-On Summary

---

### üü¶ **Day 1: S3 Access Troubleshooting**

**Simulated Errors:**
- `403 AccessDenied` ‚Äì IAM or bucket policy restriction
- `404 NotFound` ‚Äì Missing object or wrong path
- `400 BadRequest` ‚Äì Malformed URL

**Actions Taken:**
- Created S3 bucket via Console & CLI  
- Uploaded object using CLI  
- Created IAM user with limited permissions  
- Simulated access errors by removing `s3:GetObject`  
- Added inline policy, removed explicit deny  
- Used `--debug` CLI flag for tracing errors  

---

### üü© **Day 2: EC2 SSH & Boot Debugging**

**Simulated Issues:**
- SSH timeout ‚Üí Port 22 blocked  
- Permission denied ‚Üí Wrong user  
- Missing key pair ‚Üí Unable to connect  
- Instance boot errors ‚Üí No system logs

**Actions Taken:**
- Launched EC2 with no SSH access + wrong user  
- SSH from local Ubuntu VM failed  
- Used:
  - `aws ec2 describe-instances`
  - `aws ec2 get-console-output`
- Fixed by:
  - Adding port 22 in SG  
  - Relaunching with proper key pair  
  - Using correct username (`ec2_user`)  
  - Rebooting instance and checking logs  

---

### üü® **Day 3: IAM AccessDenied Debugging**

**Simulated Case:**
IAM user running CLI commands fails with:

 `An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the DescribeInstances operation: User is not authorized to perform: ec2:DescribeInstances`


**Root Causes Simulated:**
- No policy attached for EC2 access  
- Explicit deny (optional test)  
- Policy allows only specific resources or regions  
- Wrong CLI profile

**Steps Taken:**
1. Created IAM user `brokenIAMUser` with S3 read-only access  
2. Configured CLI profile:
    `aws configure --profile brokenIAMUser`

```bash
aws s3 ls --profile brokenIAMUser                          # ‚úÖ Success
aws ec2 describe-instances --profile brokenIAMUser         # ‚ùå AccessDenied
aws ec2 describe-instances --debug --profile brokenIAMUser # üîç Traced
```

Fixed by attaching:

`AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`

or inline custom policy allowing `ec2:DescribeInstances`

Re-tested and validated access

### üîê Fix Steps Summary

| Issue                    | Root Cause                             | Fix Applied                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| S3 AccessDenied          | No permission or explicit deny         | Updated IAM and bucket policies                  |
| EC2 SSH timeout          | Port 22 not open                       | Added inbound rule in SG                         |
| EC2 Permission denied    | Key pair missing or wrong user         | Used valid key + default username                |
| IAM AccessDenied on EC2  | Missing `ec2:DescribeInstances`        | Attached EC2 read-only policy                    |
| Wrong CLI profile        | Wrong key or region in config          | Switched to correct profile                      |


## üß† Reflections

- S3 access issues often result from multi-layered policies (IAM + bucket + block public access).
- EC2 SSH failures mimic real-world panic cases ‚Äî knowing how to read console logs is crucial.
- IAM permission debugging using --debug and understanding evaluation flow is a core support skill.
- CLI profile separation is great for testing policies in isolation ‚Äî just like support engineers do.
