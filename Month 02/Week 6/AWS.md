# Week 06 ‚Äì Cloud Learning Track

---

This week focuses on practical troubleshooting tasks for common AWS services (S3, EC2) aligned with real-world support issues. Each day simulates a support ticket with CLI-based debugging, step-by-step fixes, and reflection.

---

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered

| Day | Service | Focus Area |
|-----|---------|------------|
| 1   | S3      | Access issues, permission models, 403/404 debugging |
| 2   | EC2     | SSH access, security groups, key pair recovery      |

## üß™ Hands-On Summary

### üü¶ **Day 1: S3 Access Troubleshooting**

**Simulated Errors:**
- `403 AccessDenied`: Missing or blocked permission
- `404 Not Found`: Wrong object or bucket
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid URL syntax

**Key Tasks:**
- Created S3 bucket via CLI/Console
- Uploaded test object
- Created IAM user with limited access
- Simulated and fixed permission errors using IAM and bucket policies
- Used `--debug` flag to trace CLI-level access issues

---

### üü© **Day 2: EC2 Boot & SSH Access Troubleshooting**

**Simulated Errors:**
- Timeout on SSH (port 22 blocked)
- Key pair not attached
- Wrong SSH user
- Console logs missing

**Key Tasks:**
- Launched EC2 without key pair + blocked port 22
- Attempted SSH from local Ubuntu VM
- Debugged using:
  - `describe-instances`
  - `get-console-output`
- Fixed by:
  - Opening port 22 in SG
  - Relaunching EC2 with valid key pair
  - Using correct SSH user (`ubuntu`)
  - Rebooting instance and checking logs

## Policies

- [IAM Policy](./Scripts/policy.json)
- [Bucket Policy](./Scripts/S3ReadOnlyPolicy.json)

## üß† Reflections

- üîê **S3:** Realized how access to objects depends on IAM + bucket policy + block public access. `403` errors are not always straightforward.
- üíª **EC2:** Gained hands-on experience with SSH troubleshooting: SG misconfig, key mismatch, wrong username ‚Äî just like real-world escalations.
- üõ†Ô∏è CLI tools like `--debug`, `describe-instances`, and `get-console-output` are critical in support triage workflows.
