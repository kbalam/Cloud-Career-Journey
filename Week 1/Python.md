# Week 1 – Python Progress

This week, I focused on building a strong Python foundation by covering essential scripting concepts and applying them through a mini project: an **Expense Tracker**.

---

## 🔤 Variables & Data Types

- Defined and used variables to store strings, numbers, and user input
- Worked with core data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`

---

## 🔁 Control Flow: Loops and Conditionals

- Used `if`, `elif`, `else` for logical checks
- Practiced looping with:
  - `for` and `while` loops
  - `range()`, `break`, `continue`

---

## 🧠 Functions

- Created reusable functions using `def`
- Passed arguments and returned results
- Used functions to organize project logic cleanly

---

## 📦 Built-in Data Structures

### ✅ Practiced These:
- `List`: to store transactions
- `Tuple`: used for immutable records
- `Set`: to ensure unique categories
- `Dictionary`: to map expenses by category

---

## 📂 File I/O

- Wrote data to text files for persistent storage
- Read file content to restore previous sessions

## 📂 Files in This Week

- 📜 Python Script: [`expense_tracker.py`](./scripts/expense_tracker.py)
- 📄 Output File: [`expenses.txt`](./output/expenses.txt)
