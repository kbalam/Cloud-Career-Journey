# Week 4 ‚Äì AWS Progress

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered
- CloudWatch Logs: log groups, log streams, retention
- Using `put-log-events` to send test logs via CLI
- Installing and configuring CloudWatch Agent on EC2
- Creating and testing CloudWatch Alarms on custom metrics
- Automating metric push from EC2 using Bash + cron
- Querying log data using CloudWatch Log Insights

---

## üß™ Hands-On

- Created CloudWatch log group via Console + CLI
- Sent manual log events using `put-log-events`
- Installed and configured CloudWatch Agent on EC2
- Created custom metrics using `put-metric-data`
- Triggered alarms on thresholds like `CPU > 70`
- Wrote `metric.sh` and scheduled it with cron
- Ran Log Insights queries for filtering logs and extracting fields
