# Week 2 â€“ Linux Progress

## âœ… Topics Covered
- Using `sudo`, `apt`, and basic Linux administration
- File and directory permissions (`chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`)
- User and group management: `useradd`, `usermod`, `userdel`, groups
- Login monitoring tools: `whoami`, `who`, `id`, `w`, `uptime`, `last`
- Special permissions: SUID, SGID, Sticky Bit
- Umask and permission defaults
- File attributes: `lsattr`, `chattr`
- Cron jobs and scheduling scripts
- Bash scripting: `#!/bin/bash`, variables, `echo`

## ðŸ§ª Hands-On
- Created users and groups using `useradd` and `groupadd`
- Modified and deleted users with `usermod` and `userdel`
- Tested file permissions with `chmod`, octal notation, directory restrictions
- Used `find` to locate and change permissions recursively
- Explored `passwd` and `shadow` files for account control
- Wrote and executed a shell script to print system info (date, uptime, user)
- Scheduled the script with `crontab` to run every 5 minutes

- [Crontab](./screenshots/Terminal%20Screenshots/crontab.png)
- [Script running via cron](./screenshots/Terminal%20Screenshots/cron-job-running.png)

## ðŸ§  Reflections
- Learned how Linux uses layered security via file permissions and special bits
- Understood how automation through cron simplifies monitoring
- SUID and Sticky Bit were tricky at first but make sense with hands-on testing
- `lsattr` and `chattr` were new but useful for locking important files
